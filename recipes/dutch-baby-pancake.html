    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p>Dutch baby pancakes are like a hybrid (or a love child, if you will) of a pancake, a crepe, and a popover — all in one giant skillet. It feels like a party trick, but for the breakfast crowd. I break these out whenever anyone in my house needs a little extra delight in their day.</p>
        <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
<ul>
<li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
<li>3 eggs</li>
<li>¾ cup milk, room temperature</li>
<li>¾ cup flour</li>
<li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
<li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
<li>1 pinch salt</li>
<li>2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar, or to taste</li></ul>
<p><h2>Directions/Steps</h2></p>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Place butter in an ovenproof pan or cast iron skillet and place in the oven.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, combine eggs and milk in a bowl. Add flour, sugar, vanilla extract, and salt and whisk for 1 minute to remove lumps.</li>
    <li>Remove hot pan from oven and swirl melted butter to coat. Pour batter into the hot pan and return it to the oven.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the pancake is puffed in the center and golden brown on the edges, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
    <li>Dust with confectioners' sugar and serve immediately.</li>
</ol>
<p><h2>Chef's Tips</h2></p>
<ul>
<li>Use room-temperature milk and eggs to ensure a fluffier, airier pancake. <ul><li><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/bringing-eggs-to-room-temperature-quickly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Bring Eggs to Room Temperature</a></ul></li>
<li>Mix ingredients in a food processor or blender to make the batter extra smooth.</li>
<li>Allow batter to rest while you heat your pan so it's super hot. This gives the flour time to absorb the liquid.</li>
<li>Toppings can be sweet or savory.<ul><li>Go classic with confectioners' sugar and a squeeze of lemon juice, or top with berries, fried apples, syrup, whipped cream, nuts, jam, or Nutella.</li> <li>Savory toppings can include crème fraîche, smoked salmon, thinly sliced ham, or herbed cheese.</li></li></li></ul>
<li>Dutch Baby pancakes start deflating as soon as you pull them from the oven, so get your photos quickly and be ready to serve hot from the skillet.</li>
